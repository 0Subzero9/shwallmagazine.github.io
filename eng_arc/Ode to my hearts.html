    <h1>Ode to my hearts</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <p>Thou pleaded to be my muse
            Oh my sweetheart!
            Thou pleaded to not be her’s
            Oh my heart!
            I declined most my values
            And accepted both thy requests. <br>
            <br>
            While my heart
            Thou are mine,
            Utterly confused, I ask
            Am I thine?<br>
            <br>
            And my heart?
            Must I remain a mystery to thee?
            Or maybe, from within I hear murmurs
            Have I lost thee?
            Without my or thy knowledge,
            While in me beats her’s,
            And thou, in privilege
            Resonate inside her, harmonious with her’s?<br>
            <br>
            Must I remain such to myself, my hearts?
            Writing hymns and odes
            In both thy names,
            Still for me and still for thee?<br>
            <br>
            Oh my hearts! Oh my muses!
            Have I lost the ability
            To differentiate thee apart?
            Can I really not,
            Accept both thy request?<br>
            <br>
            Oh but now I know,
            All I need do, is let go-
            Let go of all the beautiful emotions,
            And embrace all my values,
            And that way, accept both thy requests.<br>
            </p>
