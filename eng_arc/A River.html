    <div class="story">
        <p>    Standing before the creature, the man thought… <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        What are demons? Was this creature truly a demon? If you search in the dictionary you will find that demons are evil spirits. If you ask locals, they will say that those who eat humans are demons. But if you think deeply for some time, the answer will be “humans”. We kill thousands of animals everyday for fulfilling our hunger. Sometimes we take the lives of animals just for the thrill of it. We never even give a single thought to the fact that, they are living creature, just like us. They also think and feel. Maybe of we saw from their perspective, humans would have fangs and red eyes. Yet when some creature starts killing humans in fantasies, they are termed as ‘Demons’.<br><br>
        But alas! This wasn’t a fantasy. The creature standing in front of him had already taken many lives, including that of his family’s. He was surprised to feel such intense abhorrence towards the creature. Yet he was very calm. Why was he hesitating? It wouldn’t take much to kill it now. He could see himself doing it easily. Was it because he saw the reflection of his own beliefs in this wretched creature? In one sense, this creature wasn’t a dream. It was a hero. It had cleansed the world of so many humans. ‘Humans’ who take the life of their own mother. Oh, how much he hated the hypocrisy of the species. The thing before him had just done what he couldn’t bring himself to do. In that case, should he end it’s life? Did he have the right?<br><br>
        As doubts resurfaced in the back of his mind, he quickly discarded it. This was the same creature who had taken the life of his beloved wife. If he killed it now, maybe someone else’s innocent wife or any closed person wouldn’t have to die along with the bad ones. Or maybe that was a necessary sacrifice to make the world a better place. No, he had to kill it now. Anymore reasoning and the outcome might be disastrous. So, he aimed the pistol and pulled the trigger. As the mirror shattered to the floor, the sound of the shot and the glass echoed into the empty bathroom. He turned the pistol and shot again. It was a head shot. The pistol fell from his stand as he fell to the ground. Blood streamed down his head and created a river. A river whose waterfall appeared to be a drain hole. A river which would soon die from no source of recycling. A river, which had a last wish. A river which hoped against hope that death od someone like its master would contribute even a little to world peace, instead of the opposite.
