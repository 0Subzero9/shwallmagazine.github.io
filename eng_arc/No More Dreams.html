    <h1>No More Dreams</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <p>Know, I don’t bear grief anymore,
No longer merge myself in endless tears.
Now, the smile on my face shines brightly,
Wiping away the tears hidden in the depth of my eyes. <br>
<br>
Now, I don’t spend nights anymore,
Staring at that distant sky.
Do not weave intricate dreams,
Among the busy stars anymore.<br>
<br>
Now, I don’t want to hear anymore,
Those meaningless words chasing after me.
There are no more tears left in my eyes,
And no more smiles on my face.<br>
<br>
Now, I don’t want to stay in wait for someone,
Throwing pebbles at the river of fate.
I don’t want to hear you breathe,
Late in the nights as before.<br>
<br>
Know, I don’t want these false dreams anymore,
Do not want to tell stories under the moonlit sky,
Do not want to get caught amidst the mesmerizing sights,
Do not want to get washed away in the tide of illusions,
Now, I am not the same I was before.<br>
