    <h1>Meaning</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <p>We all are born into this world, and we all die in it. We work hard to achieve what we want in life. But never can we seem to run out of things to want. We create ambitions to run after in life, ideals to believe in, principles to follow. In the end, though, do any of such even matter in the grand calculus of the universe? <br>
            <br>
            When people build lines for themselves, they hardly consider the fact that anything they may do has little to no effect in this world. People bind their lives with ideals, principles and superstitions but never do they consider the fact that people die, and eventually, their ideals along with them. Many people may disagree on that part, but the fact is, nothing is permanent. One may be able to imprint a thought into the culture of a community but cultures and traditions change, and so do the people who follow them. <br>
            <br>
            We assign attributes as “good” or “bad” with things to suit our lifestyles. But why does any of it, in the end, matter? The events or substances in this world that we comprehend as “good” or “bad” are in the end, events or substances like any other. We create these beliefs according to our culture and continue to see them as such. We differentiate between order and chaos believing they are opposites, two ends of a pole which may never meet, but these two things are the very foundations of the world we live in.<br>
            <br>
            Order, when forced in this world sparks chaos. These sparks ignite flames that consume all, to extinguish which we create order. In this never-ending cycle of peace and torment we call life, we work relentlessly to build peace, yet we fight wars in its name. In the end, there is no such thing as true peace, only enigma for the victors and sufferings for the defeated. There are only two things obtained from war, tormentors and the tormented. In the end, to achieve peace, people merely create sufferings.<br>
            <br>
             We create laws in society about equality and humanism, yet the powerful merely look down on the needy and peasants using them. Ironically, this very scenario is the one we hoped to destroy. The ideals we create remain as but blind beliefs we act on. They are but desperate attempts at making ourselves feel superior to other beings that exist. All the while, we remain just as much an animal, deep down in our hearts. And henceforth I openly present the inquiry, does there truly exist any meaning to anything we do in these lives of ours?<br>
