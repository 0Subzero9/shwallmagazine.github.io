    <h1>Evanescent</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <p>Chuckles at a bench,
            Students in the playground,
            All just a memory now. <br>
            <br>
            Pen clicks of a new year begins,
            Calendar changes so fast,
            Those alphabets in kindergarten,
            Where have I them lost?<br>
            <br>
            That white uniform, schoolbag,
            Shoes soaked in mud,
            Rainy days with football matches,
            Can you call them absurd?<br>
            <br>
            Slowly passing by,
            Similarly out of sight,
            Losing touch with my,
            Juvenile friends of high.<br>
            <br>
            Will I ever meet them,
            Or is this the end?
            I guess we will know,
            If the curse is evanescent.<br>
            </p>
