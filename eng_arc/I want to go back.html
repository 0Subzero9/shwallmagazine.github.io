    <h1>I want to go back</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <p>I want to go back
            In the midst of peace and joy
            Where the stream is flowing by,
            Where you can never annoy. <br>
            <br>
            In the beds of the river
            And to walk by the loamy stay
            Motorcycle horns, engineâ€™s
            Oh, gentle breeze! Take all these away.<br>
            <br>
            I want to go back
            Where the rivulet is beckoning,
            To ablution in the river bed
            When the stream goes murmuring.<br>
            <br>
             I want to go back
            To the green meadow
            Where the cattle are grazing
            Under the willow.<br>
            <br>
            I want to go back
            To my own world eternally
            Where the sky and earth merge together,
            Oh! I want to go back forever.<br>
            </p>
