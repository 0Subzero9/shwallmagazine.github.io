    <h1>Death</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <p>What do we fear? When do we fear? Why do we fear?<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            All of these questions, relating to all people and animals, can be explained with the simple concept of the five-letter word, Death. We fear death above all, no matter how much one may deny it. Death of the ultimate agony of both the conscious and subconscious mind.  Though it is inevitable and possibly the one and only thing that is certain in life, it is surprisingly the topic that is the least spoken of. When we think about death, the first things that cross our minds are the angel of death, a grave on maybe even the grim reaper, depending on what we believe. <br>
            <br>
            Death is a factor of this world that is largely unknown to us. And since we the brings with life fear what we do not know about, it terrifies our minds to think about such. As a result, we assign many beliefs with the topic of death, filling our lack of knowledge on the topic with thoughts about what it is, and what may come afterwards. Some believe it is the end of everything, while others believe it to be the gateway of reincarnation into another life. Though what is truly is, the living world has not seen, nor experienced. <br>
            <br>
            We celebrate our births into this world with different customs and traditions passed down from generation to generation. I openly present the doubt if any of the readers of this article had been born without their parents bursting with joy or feeling sweetmeat to the relatives. We celebrate “Birthdays” every year on the calendar date of when we were born, but how many of us have wondered the fact that we are not actually celebrating our birth? Rather, that day is gone forever, and the celebrations we observe are but numbers and names we assign to our time intervals on our calendars, created only to suit our lifestyle. <br>
            <br>
            What we truly celebrate every year, though, is but losing a year of our like spans, growing closer to our death. When we realize that though, many of us would probably just not celebrate these “Birthdays” but may even come to fear it. Alas, still there are celebrations and no thought for our ultimate friend, Death. <br>
            <br>
            Birth is in fact more common than death statistically, but when we think about it, birth is far, far rarer than death. Death is something that is inevitable, something that is sure to happen, while on the other hand, Birth remains more unlikely than death. What if a person’s parents had never met? What if they married someone else? What if the mother had died before giving birth? In all of these cases, the results remain the same. The person isn’t born. If you have ever heard about the theory of relativity by famed Scientist Albert Einstein, you may be familiar with the concept of parallel dimensions, existing and functioning at the same time. When you take into consideration, the changes of events discussed don’t remain so small after all. Birth is, was and always will be a “Black Swan Event”, while death remains certain. And yet, here we are, celebrating uncertainty, and ignoring the inevitable.
