        <h1>I am a disorder</h1>
        <div class="story">
            <p>Whoever is currently reading this, beware! Because now the deadliest disorder of the society has grasped your attention. No, don’t worry. I am not highly contagious and you people have built up such a humongous immunity system against me that I am rarely seen in you guys. You want to know who I am? Let me tell you about my tragic life. <br>
                <br>
                Once upon a time, I was the ruler of human hearts. Most of the people of this world wasted hours after hours, maintained thousands of restrictions, performed lots of activities just to invite me inside them. Thus, I became an elixir which made people eternal in the golden pages of history. But… Suddenly, people started to misunderstand me. They thought me as their controller. They wanted to be free. So, they revolted and kicked me out of their hearts and declared me as the greatest disorder. You know what my fault was? My fault was I couldn’t resist myself when I saw someone got beaten brutally and rushed to save him when all the other people were busy with making live videos. You want to know my fault? The renowned politicians kicked me out just because I didn’t let him swap the money out of those poor people. When I saw a pregnant woman standing in the bus, I stood up and left my seat for her. It is me who resists the drunk brother from raping his sister. And this is the problem with me. When everyone in the society wants to enjoy all these illegal works, I stand in front of them. I can’t let them go and that’s the problem with me. Nobody likes me now. I have lost my golden era. But, to the gracious court of God, I submit all the injustices done against me. Hope, one day, people will again give me that precious position in their heart and no more treat me like a disorder.<br>
                <br>
                Oh! You want to know my name? My name is – “Humanity”.<br>
