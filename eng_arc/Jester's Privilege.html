    <h1>Jester’s Privilege</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <p>Visceral waves of intellect,
            An ordinary find more or less.
            The arrow of trout you dare deflect,
            “The cap and bells”, an unswollen address. <br>
            <br>
            The sharpness of a tongue well bred,
            It cuts you down you bleed regret. 
            Had you not handed me my marotte,
            One could have enjoyed their upper hand.<br>
            <br>
            All in the name of amusement and jest,
            Lottery of McCleary, a strange request.
            You have nothing a scepter at best,
            “Throw away your crown”, Just a jester’s behest. <br>
            <br>
            In exchange of an elicit of a rise,
            Ignorance and dismissal is my prize.
            A waste of prudence lice no other.
            Along the lines of revenge, meet me at the edge,
            A fool’s perfect use of jester’s privilege.<br>
            </p>
